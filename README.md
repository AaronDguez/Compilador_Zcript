This is a repo for the Zcript's compiler, which is an attempt to fusion the JS variables, Python logic and C# syntax into a single language.
Also, this is a college project for the 'Lenguajes y Automatas' I & II class.

Done in Visual Studio 2022 and C# v9.0+

Currently, the sintatic stage is broken, but every other stage should work.
Check the .xlsx files to see the meaning of the matrix used in the Lexic stage and the syntax of the langueje created.
